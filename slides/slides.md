Brothers and sisters, do not slander one another.

Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister <br/>
or judges them speaks against the law and judges it.

When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, <br/>
but sitting in judgment on it.

There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, <br/>
the one who is able to save and destroy.

But you -- who are you to judge your neighbor?

Now listen, you who say, <br/>
“Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, <br/>
spend a year there, carry on business and make money.”

Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. <br/>
What is your life? You are a mist that appears <br/>
for a little while and then vanishes.

Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, <br/>
we will live and do this or that.”

As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. <br/>
All such boasting is evil.
