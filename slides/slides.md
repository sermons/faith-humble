Brothers and sisters, do not **slander** one another.

Anyone who **speaks against** a brother or sister <br/>
or **judges** them speaks against the **law** and judges it.

When you **judge** the law, you are not **keeping** it, <br/>
but sitting in judgment on it.

There is only one **Lawgiver** and **Judge**, <br/>
the one who is able to **save** and **destroy**.

But you -- **who are you** to judge your neighbor?

Now listen, you who say, <br/>
“**Today** or tomorrow we will **go** to this or that city, <br/>
spend a **year** there, carry on **business** and make **money**.”

<span class="ref">14</span>
Why, you do not even know <br/>
what will happen **tomorrow**.

What is your **life**? You are a **mist** that appears <br/>
for a little while and then **vanishes**.

<div class="ref">
James 4:13-14 (NIV) (p.3/4)

<span class="ref">15</span>
Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the **Lord’s will**, <br/>
we will **live** and **do** this or that.”

<span class="ref">16</span>
As it is, you **boast** in your arrogant **schemes**. <br/>
All such boasting is **evil**.
