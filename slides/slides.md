Brothers and sisters, do not **slander** one another.

Anyone who **speaks against** a brother or sister <br/>
or **judges** them speaks against the **law** and judges it.

When you **judge** the law, you are not **keeping** it, <br/>
but sitting in judgment on it.

<span class="ref">14</span>
Why, you do not even know <br/>
what will happen **tomorrow**.

What is your **life**? You are a **mist** that appears <br/>
for a little while and then **vanishes**.

All such boasting is **evil**.
