Brothers and sisters, do not **slander** one another.

Anyone who **speaks against** a brother or sister <br/>
or **judges** them speaks against the **law** and judges it.

When you **judge** the law, you are not **keeping** it, <br/>
but sitting in judgment on it.

Why, you do not even know <br/>
what will happen **tomorrow**.
